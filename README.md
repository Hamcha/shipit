# shipit - Stop cloning in your CI!

`shipit` is a tool for committing changes to JSON/YAML files from CI environments to supported Git providers.

## Why?

GitOps-enabled environments use git repositories to store deployment manifests. It's common to have the CI update those repositories but the traditional "git clone/commit/push" approach can lead to a lot of time wasted downloading unneeded info. `shipit` leverages REST APIs provided by certain Git providers (such as GitHub, GitLab, and moreâ€”see the list below) to make the process super snappy!
